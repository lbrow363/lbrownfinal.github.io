            <p> For me, life is an ongoing inquiry; it's about the questions more than the answers. I'm naturally
                curious and have a knack for trivia. I enjoy cooking, yoga, and travel. My favorite places I've visited so far have been Toronto, ON
                and Panama. My brother is an Airman in South Korea and I'd like to visit him/Seoul next.
                I'll be at Ford Credit for 8 years this April. 
                My career at the CSC has provided me with opportunities to build reports, draft content for letter
                libraries, and demonstrate how use of color, font, and style can make information more
                accessible to an audience.
                <br><br>I am interested in coding in order to challenge myself and surround myself with people I can
                continue to learn from. I seek to leverage my experience at the CSC to act as liason between the
                buisiness center world and the tech world, so I'd like to be involved in UX Design in some capacity. As
                a result of my years with the CSC, I am dialed in to Customer Experience.
                Additionally, my time spent as a People Leader has sharpened my awareness of Employee Experience. I can
                see myself contributing to the simplification and optimization of internal systems to create a
                more pleasant and efficient experience for our end-users.
