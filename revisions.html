        My friend Nicholas introduced me to Linux, so I asked him for feedback. He suggested adding a navigation bar, to which I responded, "There is one." <br>
        Much to my chagrin, I discovered my pages had originally looked like this after uploading to GitHub:<br><br>
        <a href="og homepage.png" target="_blank"><img src="og homepage.png" title=ope! alt="An image of my original homepage." width="500" border=1px></a>
        <a href="og foodpage.png" target="_blank"><img src="og foodpage.png" title=d'oh! alt="An image of my original food page." width="500" height="256" border=1px></a>
        <br><br>
        <article align="center">
            <div style="background-color:#f8f4f1;">
        What happened here may seem simple to the experienced software engineer, but at first deployment my heart dropped into my stomach because this was <b>not</b> the way my pages were 
        rendering when viewing with Live Server in VS Code. I seriously thought I broke everything!
        I poured over my style sheet, aware that it was suggesting errors, yet those errors did not impact styling when viewing in Live Server.
        After convincing myself that it wasn't an issue with the style sheet itself, I went back to my repository to see why GitHub wasn't rendering my styles.
        Upon reviewing my files, the lightbulb came on: <i>I hadn't updloaded my style sheet to the repository!</i>
        I crossed my fingers and uploaded my style sheet to the repository, and experienced the triumph of indpendently figuring out the solution to my problem.
        <br><br>As for the style sheet errors, time contstraints have kept me from perfecting the syntax there. Since it's rendering, I'm leaving it be.
