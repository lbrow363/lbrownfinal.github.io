        The foods I eat have been 90% plant-based for over five years now. 
        Cooking is one of my favorite creative expressions. In making a meal, I can create a masterpiece that serves
        one of the simplest and highest functions: <u>providing nourishment.</u>

        My process when cooking involves a lot of tasting, and asking the dish what <i>it</i> wants in order to
        manifest.
        I have made this several times over the years, and this recipe has evolved from an amalgamation of several
        online recipes.
         It is one of my favorite comfort foods to enjoy during the cold winter months.

                    You can also use store-bought, but be careful! Some brands will break apart like an overcooked
